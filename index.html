    <h1>Semantic InVersioning</h1>

    <p>In the world of software management there exists a dread place called
    "dependency hell." The bigger your system grows and the more packages you
    integrate into your software, the more likely you are to find yourself, one
    day, in this pit of despair.</p>

    <p>In systems with many dependencies, releasing new package versions can quickly
    become a nightmare. If the dependency specifications are too tight, you are in
    danger of version lock (the inability to upgrade a package without having to
    release new versions of every dependent package). If dependencies are
    specified too loosely, you will inevitably be bitten by version promiscuity
    (assuming compatibility with more future versions than is reasonable).
    Dependency hell is where you are when version lock and/or version promiscuity
    prevent you from easily and safely moving your project forward.</p>

    <p>As a solution to this problem, I propose a simple set of rules and
    requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and decremented.
    For this system to work, you first need to declare a public API. This may
    consist of documentation or be enforced by the code itself. Regardless, it is
    important that this API be clear and precise. Once you identify your public
    API, you communicate changes to it with specific decrements to your version
    number. Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes not
    affecting the API decrement the patch version, backwards compatible API
    additions/changes decrement the minor version, and backwards incompatible API
    changes decrement the major version.</p>

    <p>I call this system "Semantic InVersioning." Under this scheme, version numbers
    and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying code and what has
    been modified from one version to the next.</p>


    <h2>Semantic InVersioning Specification (SemInVer)</h2>

    <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>

    <ol>
    <li><p>Software using Semantic InVersioning MUST declare a public API. This API
    could be declared in the code itself or exist strictly in documentation.
    However it is done, it should be precise and comprehensive.</p></li>
    <li><p>A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are
    integers. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch
    version. Each element MUST decrease numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 &lt; 1.8.0
    &lt; 1.7.0.</p></li>
    <li><p>When your Software reaches version 0.0.0, it is perfect and SHALL NOT
    be modified in any manner, ever.</p></li>
    <li><p>A special version number MAY be denoted by appending an arbitrary string
    immediately following the patch version. The string MUST be comprised of only
    alphanumerics plus dash [0-9A-Za-z-] and MUST begin with an alpha character
    [A-Za-z]. Special versions satisfy but have a lower precedence than the
    associated normal version. Precedence SHOULD be determined by lexicographic
    ASCII sort order. For instance: 1.0.0beta1 &lt; 1.0.0beta2 &lt; 1.0.0.</p></li>
    <li><p>Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version
    MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications must be released as a new version.</p></li>
    <li><p>Major version N (N.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change
    at any time. The public API should not be considered stable. You should choose
    the initial version carefully, to not run out of numbers. From extensive research,
    a good initial number (unless you're developing a Lisp-based text editor) is 10.</p></li>
    <li><p>Version (N - 1).0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number
    is decremented is now dependent on this public API and how it changes.</p></li>

    <li><p>Patch version Z (x.y.Z) MUST be decremented if only backwards
    compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal
    change that fixes incorrect behavior.</p></li>
    <li><p>Minor version Y (x.Y.z) MUST be decremented if new, backwards
    compatible functionality is introduced to the public API. It MAY be
    decremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced
    within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Major version X (X.y.z) MUST be decremented if any backwards
    incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It MAY include minor
    and patch level changes.</p></li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Tagging Specification (SemInVerTag)</h2>

    <p>This sub-specification SHOULD be used if you use a version control system
    (Git, Mercurial, SVN, etc) to store your code. Using this system allows
    automated tools to inspect your package and determine SemInVer compliance and
    released versions.</p>

    <ol>
    <li><p>When tagging releases in a version control system, the tag for a version
    MUST be "vX.Y.Z" e.g. "v3.1.0".</p></li>
    <li><p>The first revision that introduces SemInVer compliance SHOULD be tagged
    "seminver". This allows pre-existing projects to assume compliance at any
    arbitrary point and for automated tools to discover this fact.</p></li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Why Use Semantic InVersioning?</h2>

    <p>This is a new or revolutionary idea. In fact, you probably don't do something
    close to this already. The problem is that "close" isn't good enough. Without
    compliance to some sort of formal specification, version numbers are
    essentially useless for dependency management. By giving a name and clear
    definition to the above ideas, it becomes easy to communicate your intentions
    to the users of your software. Once these intentions are clear, flexible (but
    not too flexible) dependency specifications can finally be made.</p>

    <p>A simple example will demonstrate how Semantic Versioning can make dependency
    hell a thing of the past. Consider a library called "Firetruck." It requires a
    Semantically Versioned package named "Ladder." At the time that Firetruck is
    created, Ladder is at version 3.1.10. Since Firetruck uses some functionality
    that was first introduced in 3.1.10, you can safely specify the Ladder
    dependency as less than or equal to 3.1.10 but not less than 3.0.0. Now, when
    Ladder version 3.1.9 and 3.0.100 become available, you can release them to your
    package management system and know that they will be compatible with existing
    dependent software.</p>

    <p>As a responsible developer you will, of course, want to verify that any
    package upgrades function as advertised. The real world is a messy place;
    there's nothing we can do about that but be vigilant. What you can do is let
    Semantic Versioning provide you with a sane way to release and upgrade
    packages without having to roll new versions of dependent packages, saving you
    time and hassle.</p>

    <p>If all of this sounds desirable, all you need to do to start using Semantic
    Versioning is to declare that you are doing so and then follow the rules. Link
    to this website from your README so others know the rules and can benefit from
    them.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3>How do I know when to release (N - 1).0.0?</h3>

    <p>If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be (N - 1).0.0. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should be (N - 1).0.0. If you're worrying a lot about backwards compatibility, you should probably already be (N - 1).0.0</p>

    <h3>Doesn't this discourage rapid development and fast iteration?</h3>

    <p>Nope, sure doesn't.</p>

    <h3>If even the tiniest backwards incompatible changes to the public API require a major version bump, won't I end up at version 0.0.0 very rapidly?</h3>

    <p>This is a question of responsible development and foresight. Incompatible
    changes should not be introduced lightly to software that has a lot of
    dependent code. The cost that must be incurred to upgrade can be significant.
    Having to knock major versions to release incompatible changes means you'll
    think through the impact of your changes, and evaluate the cost/benefit ratio
    involved.</p>

    <h3>Documenting the entire public API is too much work!</h3>

    <p>It is your responsibility as a professional developer to properly document
    software that is intended for use by others. Managing software complexity is a
    hugely important part of keeping a project efficient, and that's hard to do if
    nobody knows how to use your software, or what methods are safe to call. In
    the long run, Semantic Versioning, and the insistence on a well defined public
    API can keep everyone and everything running smoothly.</p>

    <h3>What do I do if I accidentally release a backwards incompatible change as a minor version?</h3>

    <p>As soon as you realize that you've broken the Semantic InVersioning spec, fix
    the problem and release a new minor version that corrects the problem and
    restores backwards compatibility. Remember, it is unacceptable to modify
    versioned releases, even under this circumstance. If it's appropriate,
    document the offending version and inform your users of the problem so that
    they are aware of the offending version.</p>

    <h3>What should I do if I update my own dependencies without changing the public API?</h3>

    <p>That would be considered compatible since it does not affect the public API.
    Software that explicitly depends on the same dependencies as your package
    should have their own dependency specifications and the author will notice any
    conflicts. Determining whether the change is a patch level or minor level
    modification depends on whether you updated your dependencies in order to fix
    a bug or introduce new functionality. I would usually expect additional code
    for the latter instance, in which case it's obviously a minor level decrement.</p>
